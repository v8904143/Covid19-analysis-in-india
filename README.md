 **COVID-19 Data Analysis of India**

This repository contains the code and data for a COVID-19 data analysis project focused on India. The project aims to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize COVID-19 data to gain insights into the pandemic situation across cities in India. The analysis includes identifying pain points, death rates, and vaccination percentages.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- SQL (MS-SQL)
- Tableau

## Key Responsibility Areas

- Data Scraping
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Extract COVID-19 India data from covid19india.org.
2. Convert the data into required data frames and Excel files.
3. Analyze the data using MS-SQL (SSMS).
4. Work on data for insights and visualization using Tableau.

## Methodology

The project follows the following methodology:

1. Data Scraping:
   - Utilizing Python libraries such as Requests to extract COVID-19 data from covid19india.org.
   - Handling nested JSON data.

2. Dataframe Cleaning:
   - Using Pandas for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation.
   - Addressing missing values and formatting columns.

3. Dataframe Conversion:
   - Converting cleaned data into Excel files for further analysis and visualization.

4. Dataframe Analyzing (MS-SQL):
   - Importing cleaned data into a Microsoft SQL Server database.
   - Performing SQL queries and operations for data analysis.

5. Dataframe Visualization (Tableau):
   - Visualizing analyzed data using Tableau to gain insights into the pandemic situation.
   - Creating interactive and informative visualizations.

## Insights

Based on the analysis conducted, the following insights were derived:

- The highest number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deceased cases (3089) were found in Thrissur city, Kerala during October 2021.
- Bihar state had the maximum vaccination rate (both doses) with no reported deaths.
- Testing ratio (Tr) was inversely proportional to the number of deaths, indicating that higher testing ratios led to a gradual decrease in the number of deceased cases.
- As the testing ratio increased, the number of recovered cases also increased, suggesting the effectiveness of comprehensive testing in identifying and treating cases.

## Visualizations

Here are a few visualizations showcasing the COVID-19 data analysis:

## Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of data in navigating complexities, identifying risks, and tracking progress towards recovery. The visualizations and stories derived from this analysis inspire us to utilize data to gain new perspectives and find answers to pressing questions. By leveraging data, we can make informed decisions and adapt strategies to effectively respond to the pandemic.
